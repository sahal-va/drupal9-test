# This file contains .gitignore rules that are often used with Drupal projects.
# Because .gitignore is specific to your site and its deployment processes, you
# may need to uncomment, add, or remove rules.

# Place local settings in settings.local.php
/web/sites/*/settings*.php
/web/sites/*/services*.yml
!/web/sites/*/services.yml
/web/sites/sites.php

# Ignore paths that contain user-generated content.
/web/sites/*/files
/web/sites/*/private

# Ignore SimpleTest multi-site environment.
/web/sites/simpletest


# Ignore directories generated by Composer
#
# See the "installer-paths" section in the top-level composer.json
# file.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

/web/core/
/web/modules/contrib/
/web/themes/contrib/
/web/profiles/contrib/
/web/libraries/


# Generally you should only ignore the root vendor directory. It's important
# that core/assets/vendor and any other vendor directories within contrib or
# custom module, theme, etc., are not ignored unless you purposely do so.
/vendor/

# Ignore other scaffold files
#
# Ignore all files placed directly at the project root. Rely on
# .gitignore files placed by drupal/core-composer-scaffold to avoid
# build errors that arise if non-ignored files are scaffolded.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
/.editorconfig
/.gitattributes

# The drupal/core-composer-scaffold component will write .gitignore
# files to other locations where it scaffolds files that are not
# already ignored. We must also ignore these generated files.
/web/**/.gitignore

# Ignore drush config
/drush/


# Other common rules
# ------------------
# Ignore files generated by PhpStorm, VSCode
/.idea/
/.vscode/

# Ignore .env files as they are personal
